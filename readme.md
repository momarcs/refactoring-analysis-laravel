Refactoring Analysis
Introduction
Development norms can vary from developer to developer and framework to framework. This document analyzes the provided code and suggests possible improvements and refactoring ideas. The code is rated in terms of its quality and potential for improvement.

Code Quality Rating
The code is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 based on its quality and maintainability:

1-5: Code that just works.
6-8: Code that works and is kind of OK.
9-10: Perfect Code that rarely exists.
The code is rated in the 6-8 category, indicating that it works but could benefit from improvements and modifications.

Suggestions for Improvement
Centralize UserId Logic: The UserId Logic is written repeatedly, which should be centralized at one place and used consistently throughout the application. The same approach can be taken for authenticated user handling in the constructors.

Wrap Supportive Functions: Instead of using env(), config, and other supportive functions directly, create custom functions that wrap these functionalities. This way, any framework-level changes will require only one change in the custom function, ensuring smooth functioning across the application.

Standardize Response Format: Use a standard key-value formation (e.g., status, success, error, data) for API responses. This will improve frontend handling and API utilization.

Remove Unused Variables: Eliminate non-utilized variables and adhere to consistent conventions and coding standards. Consider making changes in the BookingRepository to improve code management, data types, and naming conventions.

Improve Naming Conventions: Enhance variable naming consistency, following a specific pattern (e.g., camel case or underscore). This will improve code readability and maintainability.

Reuse Variables: Utilize $userId and $authenticatedUser variables consistently throughout the codebase instead of duplicating them. This approach will reduce code redundancy and improve readability.

Optimize Architecture: Optimize the architecture by ensuring the Repository is aware of user_id for every request, avoiding the need to pass it as a parameter repeatedly.

Separate Helper Functions: Move general helper functions to separate helper files, instead of defining them inside BookingRepository. This will declutter the code and improve organization.

Modularize Code: Break down the BookingRepository into smaller, focused modules. Move notification functions to a separate helper, and consider creating a MailerRepository for email-related functionality.

Optimize Querying: Avoid querying CurrentUser multiple times by initializing it once at the top and reusing it throughout the code. This will improve performance.

Adhere to Repository Pattern: Ensure proper adherence to the Repository pattern. Avoid direct interaction with models and define business logic functions inside the repository itself.

OOP Concepts: Incorporate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to minimize code duplication and enhance code organization.

Centralize Data Saving Functions: Ensure that functions dealing with data saving in the database are accessed from a single place to maintain consistency and avoid bugs.

Use Queues for Email Sending: To improve performance and user experience, implement queue jobs for email sending instead of including it in the main script.

Enhance Error Handling: Improve error handling, especially in scenarios where expected properties may not exist. Validate data before using it to prevent crashes.

Create a Curl Class: Implement a dedicated class for cURL requests and access it from a single point to avoid duplicating the same code across multiple places.

Avoid Duplicate Queries: Centralize queries in a single function either within the targeted model or the repository to avoid duplicating the same queries in different places.

Conclusion
The provided code can be improved in terms of performance, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. By following the suggested improvements and refactoring ideas, the codebase can become more robust, organized, and easier to maintain. Incorporating OOP concepts and adhering to the Repository pattern will result in a more efficient and scalable codebase.
